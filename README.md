# Assignment II Power BI

## I obtained three datasets from Kaggle, and I believed that I would be able to visualize each of them even if I did visualization on one question from my business questions.

### 1 Hospital Admission Data
### 2 Video game sales
### 3 District wise crimes commit


# Hospital Admissions Data

### The statistics on hospital admissions and patient discharges are included in this data. Along with it, there is patient-related data including age, sex, location, and several other ailments that were noted.

### The outcomes were also recorded, including whether the patient was released from the hospital or passed away there.

### Business Questions:

 => Which age group required more time to recuperate than the others?  
 
 => How many patients died in the hospital from COVID?
 
 => Which department (emergency or OPD) admitted the most patients?

### This dataset starts from 2017 to 2019 which contains 3 years with more than 3000 rows. Age group and  gender are two main criteria, and data aggregation based on category and review is also included.

### In other words, I will analyze age on different criteria with gender where I would be able to get more information about this data.

# Video Game Sales

### This dataset offers a thorough examination of video game sales across multiple platforms and geographical areas. It includes information on the titles of prominent video games, their release years, and the number of units sold worldwide. It also offers data on the sales figures of games from various publishers.

### The data also sheds light on the historical growth patterns of the gaming sector. To properly assess the market demand for various video games and to decide on the creation, promotion, and distribution of their products, game developers, publishers, and marketers need access to this data. Market research, market forecasting, and strategy planning are just a few of the uses for the dataset.

### Business Question: 
=> How many PSP platforms were there in 2016?

=> How many platforms featured sports during the time frame?

=> How many units did Nintendo sell globally between 2006 and 2011?

### I came to know about many data’s on Kaggle but finally I found this data interesting for visualization which give me large amount of information about video game sales committed in district.

### Having a large amount of data—11 columns and 16599 rows—allows for the extraction of more information from the available data.

### Data aggregation based on category and review is also provided, along with platform and genre as the two key criteria. In order to learn more about this data, I will, in other words, examine the platform number according to year and on several genre criteria.

# District wise crimes commit

### The dataset on "District-wise Crimes Committed" provides information on the number of crimes committed in different districts of a particular region or country. This dataset is useful in analyzing crime patterns and trends across different regions and can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources and make informed decisions.

### The data typically includes the name of the district, the number of crimes committed in that district, the type of crimes committed, and the time period during which the crimes were committed. This dataset can be used to identify areas with high crime rates and target interventions to reduce crime, as well as to monitor changes in crime trends over time.
