# Assignment II Power BI

## I obtained three datasets from Kaggle, and I believed that I would be able to visualize each of them even if I did visualization on one question from my business questions.

### 1 Hospital Admission Data
### 2 Video game sales
### 3 District wise crimes commit


# Hospital Admissions Data

### The statistics on hospital admissions and patient discharges are included in this data.
